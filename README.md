Analyzing apparent "gaussian" distributions on cyclical (not linear) measure.  Uses von Mises distributions to handle the cyclic nature of the data.

This was just an early exploration of the data before exploring the results in greater detail.

Note: I mislabeled the two distributions in the graphs, office hours and off-hours should be reversed.  However the output values are accurately shown.
